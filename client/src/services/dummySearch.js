And they’ve enlisted co-hosts Ash Kelley and Alaina Urquhart from the hit podcast Morbid to get to the bottom of things. Welcome to their Parcast original series, Crime Countdown.

With the help of the Parcast research gods, they’ll try to shock, surprise, and one-up each other—debating each case and their rankings with a hint of humor to lighten the mood.
