We discuss the brain’s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/dr-robert-malenka-how-your-brains-reward-circuits-drive-your-choices/\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>ROKA: <a href=\"https://roka.com/huberman\">https://roka.com/huberman</a> </p><p>Levels: <a href=\"https://levels.link/huberman\">https://levels.link/huberman</a> </p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a> </p><p>Momentous: <a href=\"https://livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Robert Malenka</p><p>(00:02:37) Sponsors: ROKA &amp; Levels</p><p>(00:05:21) Dopamine &amp; Reward Circuitry</p><p>(00:11:31) Reward, Arousal, Memory &amp; Dopamine </p><p>(00:17:34) Context, Cues &amp; Dopamine Modification</p><p>(00:25:38) Memory &amp; Reward Scaling</p><p>(00:30:50) Dopamine, “Addictive Liability” &amp; Route of Administration </p><p>(00:39:07) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:40:04) Drugs of Abuse &amp; Brain Changes; Addiction &amp; Individual Variability</p><p>(00:50:51) Reinforcement vs. Reward, Wanting vs. Liking</p><p>(00:57:500 Opioids, Psychostimulants &amp; Dopamine</p><p>(01:03:38) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(01:04:51) Self-Doubt, Confidence &amp; Career</p><p>(01:12:40) Autism Spectrum Disorder</p><p>(01:19:29) Pro-Social Interaction &amp; Reward; Oxytocin, Serotonin &amp; Dopamine</p><p>(01:30:30) Nucleus Accumbens &amp; Behavior Probability</p><p>(01:38:28) Reward for Pro-Social Behavior</p><p>(01:43:13) Social Media &amp; “Addictive Liability”; Gambling</p><p>(01:52:17) Pain, Social Behavior &amp; Empathy</p><p>(02:02:19) Empathy Circuitry, Dopamine &amp; Serotonin </p><p>(02:10:07) Autism Spectrum Disorder &amp; Social Interactions, Empathy</p><p>(02:1...",

His clinical and research efforts focus on retinal and optic nerve diseases such as glaucoma and discovering stem cell and nanotechnology treatments to cure blindness. We discuss how to maintain and improve eye health throughout life, the advantages and disadvantages of corrective lenses, including if you should wear “readers,” the use and risks of contact lenses, considerations for LASIK eye surgery, floaters, dry eye, the importance of sunlight and UV protection and specific exercises to improve eye and vision health. Dr. Goldberg also explains age-related conditions: cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy; and the behavioral and supplementation-based, prescription and surgical tools used to promote eye health. This episode provides essential tools for listeners of any age and background to maintain eye health and offset vision loss.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/dr-jeffery-goldberg-how-to-improve-your-eye-health-and-offset-vision-loss\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>Maui Nui Venison: <a href=\"https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\">https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a> </p><p>Eight Sleep: <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/huberman\">https://eightsleep.com/huberman</a> </p><p>InsideTracker: <a href=\"https://insidetracker.com/huberman\">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a> </p><p>Momentous: <a href=\"https://livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg</p><p>(00:03:08) Sponsors: Maui Nui, LMNT, Eight Sleep</p><p>(00:06:29) Childhood &amp; Eye Exams</p><p>(00:11:36) Eye Misalignment &amp; Recovery</p><p>(00:20:38) Myopia (Near-Sightedness), Children &amp; Sunlight</p><p>(00:30:04) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)</p><p>(00:31:18) Eye Safety &amp; Protection; Eye Hygiene</p><p>(00:40:07) Adults &amp; Eye Exams; Optometrist vs Ophthalmologist</p><p>(00:46:35) Presbyopia (Age-Related Vision Decline), Reading Glasses</p><p>(00:54:54) Reading Glasses: Use &amp; Recommendations</p><p>(00:58:34) Night Vision &amp; Glasses</p><p>(01:02:55) Sponsor: InsideTracker</p><p>(01:03:54) Corrective Eye Glasses, Exercises</p><p>(01:09:52) Near-Far Exercise &amp; Presbyopia; Smooth Pursuit Exercise &amp; Concussion</p><p>(01:13:25) Supranormal Vision &amp; Performance Training</p><p>(01:19:11) 20/20 Vision; Visual Acuity</p><p>(01:24:51) Contact Lenses: Use, Risks &amp; Aging</p><p>(01:31:34) UV Protection &amp; Cataracts, “Blue Blockers”</p><p>(01:38:20) Light Sensitivity &amp; Eye Co...",

We discuss Tim’s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery — themes that have spanned his career that have placed him on the cutting-edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery, how to find and work with mentors, the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim’s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges and we discuss his latest creative endeavors. This episode should be of interest to a wide range of listeners, as Tim’s mastery and wisdom spans athletic and mental pursuits, business, media, technology and the arts. What distinguishes Tim is his ability to thoughtfully deconstruct these processes in order to teach others how to do the same.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/tim-ferriss-how-to-learn-better-and-create-your-best-future/\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/huberman\">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p><p>Maui Nui Venison: <a href=\"https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\">https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><p>Levels: <a href=\"https://levels.link/huberman\">https://levels.link/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href=\"https://insidetracker.com/huberman\">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href=\"https://livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Tim Ferriss</p><p>(00:04:08) Sponsors: Maui Nui, LMNT, Levels</p><p>(00:07:43) 4-Hour Body &amp; Development Mindset</p><p>(00:15:22) Origins of Good Ideas</p><p>(00:20:06) Writing &amp; Structured Thinking</p><p>(00:27:58) Writing, Night Owls</p><p>(00:33:06) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:34:21) Investigating Outliers; Social Media &amp; Smartphones</p><p>(00:40:37) Scientific Literacy, Randomized Clinical Trials</p><p>(00:45:09) Supplement &amp; Experiment Fails; Cold Exposure &amp; Hyperthermia</p><p>(00:50:46) Slow Carb Diet &amp; Adherence</p><p>(01:03:35) Morning Protein Intake; Fasting</p><p>(01:08:48) Sponsor: InsideTracker</p><p>(01:09:53) Power of Place; Building Your Network &amp; Volunteering</p><p>(01:21:43) Developing Skills; Examining Motivation &amp; Good Questions; Simplicity</p><p>(01:33:32) Early Psychedelic Exploration, Depression</p><p>(01:45:38) Psychedelic Research &amp; Mental Health Funding</p><p>(01:59:00) Saisei Foundation, Journalism Fellowship, Law &amp; Education</...",

I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces “threat detection” and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA “crash,” the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA. This should be of interest to those curious about MDMA, neuropharmacology, the origins of emotional processing in the brain, empathy, PTSD, neuroplasticity, mental health and psychiatry.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-mdma-and-its-therapeutic-applications\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/huberman\">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p><p>Helix Sleep: <a href=\"https://helixsleep.com/huberman\">https://helixsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>ROKA: <a href=\"https://roka.com/huberman\">https://roka.com/huberman</a></p><p>HVMN: <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/huberman\">https://hvmn.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href=\"https://livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) MDMA “Ecstasy”</p><p>(00:04:37) Sponsors: Helix Sleep, ROKA, HVMN</p><p>(00:08:18) MDMA History &amp; Synthesis; Legality</p><p>(00:14:45) MDMA, Methamphetamine (Meth), Dopamine &amp; Serotonin</p><p>(00:23:30) MDMA vs Psychedelics vs Ketamine</p><p>(00:26:54) MDMA &amp; Serotonin 1B Receptor, Subjective Feelings, Trauma</p><p>(00:33:36) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:34:51) Amygdala &amp; Threat Detection, Pro-Social Behavior, MDMA Dosages</p><p>(00:45:48) Interoception, MDMA &amp; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</p><p>(00:52:36) Long-Term Effects, Threat Detection &amp; PTSD</p><p>(00:56:14) MDMA, Social Connection &amp; Empathy; Meth, SSRIs</p><p>(01:06:10) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(01:07:22) Oxytocin &amp; MDMA</p><p>(01:16:10) Safety &amp; Neurotoxicity; Recreational Use, Caffeine &amp; Fentanyl</p><p>(01:26:36) Is MDMA Neurotoxic?; Poly-Pharmacology, Body Temperature</p><p>(01:37:07) Post-MDMA “Crash”, Prolactin &amp; P?5?P</p><p>(01:43:07) PTSD &amp; Trauma; Talk Therapy, SSRIs</p><p>(01:54:09) PTSD Treatment: Talk Therapy + MDMA</p><p>(02:02:46) MDMA &amp; Addiction; Dissociative PTSD &amp; Empathy</p><p>(02:09:47) Side-Effects?, MDMA Efficacy &amp; Legalit...",

I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped. I also discuss the immense individual variation in dosage sensitivity for these medications and the negative side-effects that occur from recreational use.

He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to “go internal,” and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks. As such, this episode ought to be of use to anyone interested in brain plasticity, mental health, psychology or neuroscience.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/dr-robin-carhart-harris-the-science-of-psychedelics-for-mental-health\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>Eight Sleep: <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/huberman\">https://eightsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>Levels: <a href=\"https://levels.link/huberman\">https://levels.link/huberman</a></p><p>HVMN: <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/huberman\">https://hvmn.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>The Brain Body Contract</h2><p><a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/tour\">https://hubermanlab.com/tour</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris</p><p>(00:02:12) Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels, HVMN</p><p>(00:05:41) The Brain-Body Contract</p><p>(00:06:31) Origin of the Word: “Psychedelics”; Pharmacology</p><p>(00:12:05) Psychedelics &amp; Revealing the Unconscious Mind, Psychotherapy</p><p>(00:17:32) Microdosing</p><p>(00:26:08) Psilocybin vs. Magic Mushroom Doses</p><p>(00:28:28) “Psychedelic-Therapy”, Music</p><p>(00:35:12) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:36:26) Psychedelic Journey: “Trust, Let Go, Be Open”</p><p>(00:43:01) Negative Emotions, Fear &amp; Psychedelics</p><p>(00:46:21) Global Functional Connectivity, Serotonin 2A Receptor; Subjective Experiences</p><p>(00:52:33) Pharmacology: Therapeutics without Psychedelic Effects; SSRIs</p><p>(00:58:45) Psilocybin &amp; Depression; Long-Te...",

Dr. Sobel explains his lab’s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (“olfaction”) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of “social sensing” and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab’s work on digitization of smell — which may soon allow online communication to include “sending of odors” via the internet. Dr. Sobel’s work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/dr-noam-sobel-how-smells-influence-our-hormones-health-and-behavior/\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>ROKA: <a href=\"https://roka.com/huberman\">https://roka.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href=\"https://takethesis.com/huberman\">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><p>Helix Sleep: <a href=\"https://helixsleep.com/huberman\">https://helixsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href=\"https://insidetracker.com/huberman\">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Noam Sobel</p><p>(00:03:46) Sponsors: ROKA, Thesis, Helix Sleep</p><p>(00:06:46) Olfaction Circuits (Smell)</p><p>(00:14:49) Loss &amp; Regeneration of Smell, Illness</p><p>(00:21:39) Brain Processing of Smell</p><p>(00:24:40) Smell &amp; Memories</p><p>(00:27:52) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:29:07) Humans &amp; Odor Tracking</p><p>(00:39:25) The Alternating Nasal Cycle &amp; Autonomic Nervous System</p><p>(00:48:18) Cognitive Processing &amp; Breathing</p><p>(00:54:47) Neurodegenerative Diseases &amp; Olfaction</p><p>(01:00:12) Congenital Anosmia</p><p>(01:05:01) Sponsor: InsideTracker</p><p>(01:06:19) Handshaking, Sharing Chemicals &amp; Social Sensing</p><p>(01:15:07) Smelling Ourselves &amp; Smelling Others</p><p>(01:22:02) Odors &amp; Romantic Attraction</p><p>(01:24:58) Vomeronasal Organ, “Bruce Effect” &amp; Miscarriage</p><p>(01:40:20) Social Chemo-Signals, Fear</p><p>(01:50:26) Chemo-Signaling, Aggression &amp; Offspring</p><p>(02:03:57) Menstrual Cycle Synchronization</p><p>(02:12:11) Sweat, Tears, Emotions &amp; Testosterone</p><p>(02:27:46) Science...",

Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink’s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s, Huntington’s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink’s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink’s bold and unique mission. Anyone interested in how the brain works and can be made to work better ought to derive value from this discussion.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/dr-matthew-macdougall-neuralink-and-technologies-to-enhance-human-brains/\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>HVMN: <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/huberman\">https://hvmn.com/huberman</a></p><p>Levels: <a href=\"https://levels.link/huberman\">https://levels.link/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href=\"https://takethesis.com/huberman\">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href=\"https://insidetracker.com/huberman\">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Matthew MacDougall</p><p>(00:04:05) Sponsors: HVMN, Levels</p><p>(00:07:38) Brain Function &amp; Injury; Brain Tumor Treatment</p><p>(00:13:52) Frontal Lobe Filter; Sleep Deprivation</p><p>(00:19:00) Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology &amp; Machines</p><p>(00:22:10) Neuralink, Neural Implants &amp; Injury, Robotics &amp; Surgery</p><p>(00:31:05) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:32:20) Neocortex vs. Deep Brain</p><p>(00:36:45) Decoding Brain Signals</p><p>(00:42:08) “Confidence Test” &amp; Electrical Stimulation; RFID Implants</p><p>(00:51:33) Bluetooth Headphones &amp; Electromagnetic Fields; Heat</p><p>(00:57:43) Brain Augmentation &amp; Paralysis</p><p>(01:00:51) Sponsor: InsideTracker</p><p>(01:02:09) Brain Implants &amp; Peripheral Devices</p><p>(01:12:44) Brain Machine Interface (BMI), Neurofe...",

Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair “dead” (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress.

We discuss her work showing how stress impacts mood, eating behavior, mental health, physical health, and aging. She explains stress intervention tools using “top-down” techniques (e.g., radical acceptance, mindfulness, reframing), body-based methods (e.g., breathwork) including the Wim Hof Method, exercise, meditation, body scans, and environmental shifts proven to help people cease unhealthy rumination patterns. We discuss how stress can positively impact psychology and sense of purpose, how stress affects cellular aging, how our narratives of stressful events impact our mood and biology, and how to effectively reframe stress. She explains science-based techniques to break stress-induced cycles of craving and overeating and thereby improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. Dr. Epel provides a wide range of tools shown to be effective in reducing stress and improving various aspects of our health.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"dr-elissa-epel-control-stress-for-healthy-eating-metabolism-and-aging\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>Thesis: <a href=\"https://takethesis.com/huberman\">https://takethesis.com/huberman</a></p><p>Eight Sleep: <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/huberman\">https://eightsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>HVMN: <a href=\"https://hvmn.com/huberman\">https://hvmn.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href=\"https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\">https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Elissa Epel</p><p>(00:02:17) Sponsors: Thesis, Eight Sleep, HVMN</p><p>(00:06:18) Stress; Effects on Body &amp; Mind</p><p>(00:12:50) Tools: Overthinking &amp; Stress</p><p>(00:15:37) Acute, Moderate &amp; Chronic Stress, Breathing</p><p>(00:21:23) Stress Benefits, Aging &amp; Cognition; Stress Challenge Response</p><p>(00:31:04) Sponsor: AG-1 (Athletic Greens)</p><p>(00:32:19) Tool: Shifting Stress to Challenge Response, “Stress Shields”</p><p>(00:37:400 Stress, Overeating, Craving &amp; Opioid System</p><p>(00:48:55) Tools: Breaking Overeating Cycles, Mindfulness</p><p>(00:54:44) Soda &amp; Sugary Drinks</p><p>(01:00:51) Smoking, Processed Food &amp; Rebellion</p><p>(01:05:29) Sponsor: InsideTracker</p><p>(01:06:47) Tools: Mindfulness, Pregnancy &amp; Metabolic Health</p><p>(01:14:11) Body Scan &amp; Cravings</p><p>(01:17:28) Tool: Meditation &amp; Aging; Meditation Retreats</p><p>(01:23:35) Meditation, Psychedelics &amp; Neuroplasticity</p><p>...",

We discuss his lab’s discovery that “time-restricted eating” (TRE) aka intermittent fasting, is beneficial effects for metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/dr-satchin-panda-intermittent-fasting-to-improve-health-cognition-and-longevity/\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Satchin Panda</p><p>(00:03:18) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(00:07:24) Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) &amp; Health</p><p>(00:14:38) Mealtimes &amp; Circadian Clock</p><p>(00:21:34) Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion</p><p>(00:25:28) Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat</p><p>(00:28:45) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:34:04) CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm &amp; Longevity</p><p>(00:47:20) Gender, Hormones &amp; CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS)</p><p>(00:52:40) Physical Activity, Nutrition &amp; Feeding Window</p><p>(00:59:04) Nutrition Timing, Quality &amp; Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet</p><p>(01:03:00) Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast</p><p>(01:16:20) Circadian Rhythm, “Night Owls” &amp; Genetics</p><p>(01:26:37) Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, “Me Time”</p><p>(01:30:08) Light Sensitivity &amp; “Night Owls”; Puberty, Melatonin</p><p>(01:36:05) Shift Workers, Health &amp; Disease</p><p>(01:45:43) Artificial Lights, Young Adults &amp; Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction</p><p>(01:50:59) Firefighters, Sleep &amp; TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose</p><p>(02:05:18) Shift Workers &amp; Sleep; Alcohol &amp; Caffeine</p><p>(02:09:15) 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults &amp; Children, Sleep</p><p>(02:22:10) Mea...",

I explain how temperature and pH influence water’s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called “pH water” or “alkalized water” to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.).

We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the “heritability of acquired traits” and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for some of the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi’s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate, as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/dr-oded-rechavi-genes-and-the-inheritance-of-memories-across-generations\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Oded Rechavi</p><p>(00:02:25) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(00:06:04) DNA, RNA, Protein; Somatic vs. Germ Cells</p><p>(00:14:36) Lamarckian Evolution, Inheritance of Acquired Traits</p><p>(00:22:54) Paul Kammerer &amp; Toad Morphology</p><p>(00:25:16) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:30:06) James McConnell &amp; Memory Transfer</p><p>(00:37:31) Weismann Barrier; Epigenetics </p><p>(00:45:13) Epigenetic Reprogramming; Imprinted Genes </p><p>(00:50:43) Nature vs. Nurture; Epigenetics &amp; Offspring</p><p>(00:59:06) Generational Epigenetic Inheritance </p><p>(01:10:20) Model Organisms, C. elegans</p><p>(01:21:50) C. elegans &amp; Inheritance of Acquired Traits, Small RNAs</p><p>(01:26:02) RNA Interference, C. elegans &amp; Virus Immunity</p><p>(01:34:13) RNA Amplification, Multi-Generational Effects</p><p>(01:38:41) Response Duration &amp; Environment</p><p>(01:47:50) Generational Memory Transmission, RNA</p><p>(01:59:36) Germ Cells &amp; Behavior; Body Cues</p><p>(02:04:48) Transmission of Sexual Choice</p><p>(02:11:22) Fertility &amp; Human Disease; 3-Parent In Vitro Fertilization (IVF); RNA Testing</p><p>(02:17:56) Deliberate Cold Exposure, Learning &amp; Memory</p><p>(02:29:26) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Soci...",

              "description": "<p>When 57-year-old Bruce Cucchiara was gunned down in the parking lot of a New Orleans East apartment complex in 2012 his murder devastated his family and stumped law enforcement. The father and business man seemed to be well-liked and on a positive path as he coasted toward retirement. He was also worth $5 million in life insurance. </p><p>For more than a year CounterClock's Delia D'Ambra has investigated the case and unraveled a web of bizarre information and circumstances about his life and those who benefitted from his death. The geographical and political setting of the murder has a dark history of corruption, fraud and violence and at every turn Delia discovers Bruce's complicated business life may have put him in the crosshairs of several bad actors. From allegations of a setup and ties to organized crime to Bruce being a key witness in a multi-million-dollar lawsuit to random robbery...each scenario is something the New Orleans Police Department can't rule out. Now, 11 years after his brutal slaying the questions still remain, who murdered Bruce? Why was he even in New Orleans East? Where is the murder weapon? </p><p>Delia has discovered new information, tracked down witnesses and revealed secrets within the victim's closest circle that will blow this unsolved case wide open. CounterClock Season 5 is the most extensive and explosive investigation to-date with more than two dozen interviews and over a thousand documents that tell a stranger-than-fiction story about a very real crime.

              "description": "<p>David Tice is a geopolitical strategist and producer / director of the eye opening documentary ‘Grid Down, Power Up.’ David came on to tell us about the unbelievable vulnerabilities of the U.S. power grid. Electricity–it's cheap, fast, and readily available across most of the world. We rely on electricity to survive, yet most of us take it for granted. While we've gotten comfortable, a disaster has been brewing with every light switch flipped. It's not a matter of \"if\" but \"when\" the grid will fail.</p><p>David reveals that not only has the United States invested very little in its power grid infrastructure since the 1950s, but power companies are actively lobbying to provide as little protection and updates to the grid as possible. We get into how adversaries like China &amp; Russia have openly plotted against the U.S. by way of implicating our grid and even how numerous homegrown attacks against vital electrical infrastructure has flown under the radar or at worst–purposefully ignored.</p><p>We're doing something special with this episode: giving YOU a way to get involved and make an impact. We're asking our audience to visit <a href=\"https://griddownpowerup.com/participate/\"><strong>https://griddownpowerup.com/participate/</strong></a> and take direct action to contact your legislators &amp; regulators.

Every 9 minutes, Child Protective Services finds evidence of child sexual abuse. 93% of victims know the perpetrator. These are horrifying and sobering statistics that drove the Shawn Ryan Show to expose this topic–this is where Ryan Montgomery comes in.</p><p>Ryan is the #1 \"ethical hacker\" in the world and it's a title he's earned by infiltrating websites that host child exploitation and exposing the predators that run rampant there. Ryan takes us into the underbelly of this dark-web hidden world and lights it up in real time. During the filming of this show, Ryan ran a mini-sting operation from his laptop in a chatroom, posing as a teen–it took less than 60 seconds for a predator to take the bait.</p><p>This episode is a cold, hard look at the pervasive problem that is child exploitation. Although it's difficult to stomach, we do believe that this episode will educate parents and save thousands of children. Ryan has dedicated his life to saving human life via his treatment center for those with addiction and by forcing this vile topic into the light.

She spares no detail when explaining what a society under a ruthless dictator, mass killings, and delusional propaganda looks like.</p><p>Yeonmi takes us through her harrowing journey being smuggled out of North Korea only to meet a new terrifying reality - the Chinese sex trade. Park speaks frankly about the realities of survival in captivity and the pain she carries with her still today.

              "description": "<p>Episode #50 is one of the most important interviews you'll ever hear. Chris Beck is a retired Navy Seal with 20 years service &amp; 15 deployments under his belt. Even with his Bronze Star with Valor, Chris wasn't only known for his skills behind the trigger, but for his brilliance in technology and engineering.</p><p>Chris pioneered the mission planning systems for all of SOCOM, revolutionized the future of warfare with the \"Iron Man\" Project, and contracted for the Pentagon with a $600 million dollar research and development budget. Despite all of his accomplishments, Chris was facing demons in private. TBIs, PTSD, and a traumatic childhood sent Chris down a path to find out who he truly was. Through trauma and misguided agendas, Chris transitioned to a woman and after years of being pulled into this ideology, ultimately started the long journey to transitioning back into the man he always was.</p><p>This episode explores his journey through an abusive childhood, the trans agenda, and the nuance of sexuality &amp; biology. Chris's fiance' Courtney joins us and explains how gender dysphoria can endanger and influence children and how society has reached a breakpoint with these issues. Stick around until the end of the episode to learn how Chris sparing a life in combat may have set the stage for him to save his own and how thousands of others will be.</p><p><strong>Shawn Ryan Show Sponsors:</strong></p><p>https://mudwtr.com/shawn - USE CODE \"<strong>SHAWN</strong>\"</p><p>https://hvmn.com - Use Code \"<strong>SHAWN</strong>\"</p><p>https://betterhelp.com/shawn</p><p><strong>Chris Beck Links:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/valor4us/\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/valor4us\">Twitter</a></p><p><strong>Please leave us a review on </strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shawn-ryan-show/id1492492083\"><strong>Apple</strong></a><strong> &amp; </strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5eodRZd3qR9VT1ip1wI7xQ?si=59f9d106e56a4509\"><strong>Spotify</strong></a><strong> Podcasts.</strong></p><p><strong>Vigilance Elite/Shawn Ryan Links:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.vigilanceelite.com/\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/VigilanceElite\">Patreon</a> | <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@shawnryanshow\">TikTok</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shawnryan762\">Instagram</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

In this episode, we cover the unprecedented violence that broke out in the city of Culiacán after Mexican authorities recaptured Sinaloa cartel leader Ovidio Guzmán, son of \"El Chapo.\"</p><p>Grillo breaks down the inner workings of Mexico's most notorious cartels, their recruitment strategies and growing turf wars. We cover the issues with the US / Mexico border and how fentanyl has revolutionized the drug business while wreaking havoc throughout the country. We'll discuss the question—Should cartels be designated as terrorist organizations? The answer isn't as simple as you might think.</p><p><br></p><p>Shawn Ryan Show Sponsors:</p><p><a href=\"https://hvmn.com/\">https://hvmn.com</a> - USE CODE \"<strong>SHAWN</strong>\"</p><p>https://betterhelp.com/shawn</p><p>https://mypatriotsupply.com</p><p>https://blackbuffalo.com</p><p>https://mudwtr.com/shawn - USE CODE \"<strong>SHAWNMUD</strong>\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Please leave us a review on </strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shawn-ryan-show/id1492492083\"><strong>Apple</strong></a><strong> &amp; </strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5eodRZd3qR9VT1ip1wI7xQ?si=59f9d106e56a4509\"><strong>Spotify</strong></a><strong> Podcasts.</strong></p><p><strong>Vigilance Elite/Shawn Ryan Links:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.vigilanceelite.com/\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/VigilanceElite\">Patreon</a> | <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@shawnryanshow\">TikTok</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shawnryan762\">Instagram</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

              "description": "<p>The wave of scandals that would engulf Spain began with a police raid on a wooded property outside Madrid. It was Nov. 3, 2017, and the target was José Manuel Villarejo Pérez, a former government spy. Villarejo’s name had been circulating in the Spanish press for years. He was rumored to have had powerful friends and to have kept dirt on them all. The impressive variety of allegations against him — forgery, bribery, extortion, influence peddling — had earned him the nickname “king of the sewers.”</p><p>For many decades, Villarejo’s face had been known to almost no one. He was, after all, a spy — and not just any spy, but one who had started his career in the secret police of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. In those years, he would dress in overalls from Telefónica, the national telephone company, as he conducted surveillance operations in the mountains, and on several occasions he even wore a priest’s collar in order to infiltrate the Basque separatist group ETA. More recently, Villarejo had taken to simply introducing himself as a lawyer who ran a private-investigation firm, offering those he met to dig up compromising material on their enemies. His formal connection to the government was increasingly ambiguous. Of all of the identities he assumed over the years, this was perhaps the most powerful one. It made him rich through the hefty fees he charged, and it opened a door into the worlds of business tycoons, government ministers, aristocrats, judges, newspaper editors and arms traffickers — all of whose trust he gained, all of whose private words he taped.</p><p>Villarejo was handcuffed and taken to Madrid. But as he sat in jail awaiting trial, the question left hanging over Spain was this: What happens to a country’s secrets when they have all been recorded by one man? And what happens when that man finds himself suddenly backed into a corner?</p><p><i><strong>This story was recorded by Audm</strong>.

Their experience, which culminates in a demonstration day, is supposed to be the most productive three months of the fellows’ lives. Dave Fontenot, one of HF0’s founders, was inspired by the two years he spent living in monasteries in his 20s: While monastery life was materially ascetic, he found that it was luxurious in the freedom it gave residents to focus on the things that really mattered. And this year at the Archbishop’s Mansion in San Francisco, the home of the fellows, almost everyone has been monastically focused on what has become the city’s newest religion: artificial intelligence.</p><p>The A.I. gospel had not yet spread in 2021, when Fontenot and his two co-founders, Emily Liu and Evan Stites-Clayton, started the accelerator. Even a year ago, when HF0 hosted a batch of fellows at a hotel in Miami, six out of the eight companies represented were cryptocurrency start-ups. But at the mansion in San Francisco, eight of the 10 companies in HF0’s first batch this year were working on A.I.-based apps.</p><p>That generative A.I. has largely supplanted crypto in the eyes of founders and venture capitalists alike is not exactly surprising. When OpenAI released ChatGPT late last year, it set off a new craze at a time when the collapsing crypto and tech markets had left many investors and would-be entrepreneurs adrift, unsure of where to put their capital and time. Suddenly users everywhere were realizing that A.I. could now respond to verbal queries with a startling degree of humanlike fluency. “Large language models have been around for a long time, but their uses were limited,” said Robert Nishihara, a co-founder of Anyscale, a start-up for machine-learning infrastructure. “But there’s a threshold where they become dramatically more useful, and I think now it’s crossed that.”</p><p><i><strong>This story was recorded by Audm</strong>.

              "description": "<p>Almost everyone who reads “American Born Chinese,” Gene Luen Yang’s groundbreaking graphic novel, is a little afraid of Chin-Kee.</p><p>The book is a classic of young-adult literature, threading together stories of Asian American boyhood with a revered Ming dynasty novel. Chin-Kee’s role in it is a small one, but he is the bomb at the book’s heart. He’s a kind of Urkel character, embarrassing comic relief that isn’t so funny for the people who have to live with him — a cruel marionette pieced together from ugly stereotypes. He makes the old schoolyard “me Chinese” rhymes and begins sentences with “Confucius say …” He sings “She Bangs,” in a library, in the style of the “American Idol” contestant William Hung. At one point, he eats a packed lunch with a cat peeking out of the container. A laugh track runs in a ribbon under each scene, a brutal little receipt: “HA HA HA HA HA.”</p><p>So when news arrived, in 2021, that “American Born Chinese” would be adapted as a live-action Disney+ streaming series, the first reaction from some readers was, more or less, “Oh, no.”</p><p><i><strong>This story was recorded by Audm</strong>.

He helps you remove any limits you&apos;ve unknowingly put on yourself simply with the way you speak to yourself. He offers substitute phrases, and hits you HARD with the truth in hopes you get to bypass the limits he&apos;s had to break for himself. Tough love is the only way to describe this one. But it&apos;s the kind of love that will make you feel so looked after and genuinely cared about. This episode is a game changer. <br/><br/>?

Indeed, Bobby Mackey’s is said to be the home of several spirits whose lives revolved around, and in some cases ended on the property, including the ghosts of a lovesick showgirl, a headless pregnant woman, and the two Satan-worshipping men who took her head.</p><p>Thank you to the glorious David White for research assistance :)</p><p>References</p><p>Associated Press. 1978. \"State to probe fire at club near Newport.\"&nbsp;<em>Courier-Journal</em>, July 10: 6.</p><p>—. 1993. \"Legality of lawsuit blaming bar for ghost antics to be decided.\"&nbsp;<em>Messenger-Inquirer</em>, October 23: 17.</p><p>Caraway, Robin. 2006. \"Wilder nightclub site has storied past.\"&nbsp;<em>Cincinnati Post</em>, July 17: 14.</p><p>Chicago Chronicle. 1896. \"Pearl Bryan's story.\"&nbsp;<em>Chicago Chronicle</em>, May 10: 33.</p><p>Cincinnati Enquirer. 1979. \"Kentucky closes Mackey's club, citing faulty wiriing, sprinkler.\"&nbsp;<em>Cincinnati Enquirer</em>, December 16: 26.</p><p>—. 1978. \"Wilder police chief wants state to close Hard Rock Cafe.\"&nbsp;<em>Cincinnati Enquirer</em>, January 17: 17.</p><p>Hensley, Douglas. 2005.&nbsp;<em>Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World.</em>&nbsp;Denver, CO: Outskirts Press.</p><p>Moores, Lew. 1993. \"Court filing by club's lawyer is poetry in motion.\"&nbsp;<em>Cincinnati Enquirer</em>, October 22: 26.</p><p>2005.&nbsp;<em>A Haunting.</em>&nbsp;Television.

While driving home after the concert, Denise got a flat tire on the Corona del Mar Freeway, just a few miles from her home in Newport Beach. Two days later, the car was discovered abandoned and Denise was nowhere to be found.</p><p>The disappearance of Denise Huber prompted a massive search operation in southern California and garnered considerable media attention, but their efforts turned up nothing. Years later, in 1994, a woman buying paint from a handy man in Dewey, Arizona grew suspicious of the man selling her the paint and reported her hunch to local police, including the man’s license plate number. When they ran the plate, it turned out the truck had been stolen. When they searched the vehicle a week later, investigators discovered a chest freezer in the back of the vehicle. Inside, they found the answer to a case that had stalled for years.</p><p>Thank you to the talented David White for research assistance.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",

              "description": "<p>On January 24, 2000, sheriff’s deputies in Mentone, Alabama stopped an older model Lincoln with Ohio plates that they suspected was involved in a hit-and-run accident earlier that day. The driver was thirty-seven-year-old Hayward Bissell of Norwalk, Ohio and strapped into the seat beside him was the remains of his twenty-four-year-old girlfriend, Patricia Booher. To the deputies’ horror, Booher’s hand and leg had been severed from her body, her eyes had been gouged out, and her heart and liver had been torn out, but were still in the car. Further investigation revealed that, in addition to Booher’s murder, Bissell had also attempted to kill two other couples on what appeared to be a rampage across two states.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you to the ever so talented David White for research assistance :)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>-Schizophrenia &amp; Psychosis Action Alliance -&nbsp;</p><p>Website:<a href=\"http://sczaction.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sczaction.org</a></p><p>Services: Education and support groups&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)</p><p>Website:<a href=\"http://nami.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nami.org </a>&nbsp;</p><p>Services: General resources for mental health&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Domestic Violence:&nbsp;</p><p>-US Hotline Number: 1(800)-799-7233</p><p><br></p><p>-The Battered Women's Justice Project: **We donated to them, I met with them and they are amazing**</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://bwjp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BWJP.org</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Services: Free legal help&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>-Center For Domestic Peace&nbsp;</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://centerfordomesticpeace.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Centerfordomesticpeace.org&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p>Services: Support groups</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>References</p><p>Acton, Andy. 2000. \"Secret Service questions man in mutilation case.\" <em>Birminghm Post-Herald</em>, January 26: 23.</p><p>Associated Press. 2002. \"Mental illness plea accepted.\" <em>Atlanta Constitution </em>, February 8: D12.</p><p>—. 2000. \"Couple honors heroic Labrador retrievers.\" <em>Birmingham Post-Herald</em>, March 15: 16.</p><p>—. 2001. \"Man held in mutilation slaying to undergo more mental tests.\" <em>Macon Telegraph</em>, August 13: 12.</p><p>—. 2000. \"Police probe mutilation death of woman.\" <em>The Anniston Star</em>, Janaury 25: 8.</p><p>—. 2000. \"Suspect in mutilation death of woman to be sent to mental hsopital.\" <em>The Anniston Star</em>, January 26: 12.</p><p>Bradley, Eric. 2000. \"Manty native relates tale of terror.\" <em>Manitowoc Herald-Times</em>, Jul 7: 1.</p><p>Columbus Ledger-Enquirer. 2000. \"Mental tests urged for slaying suspect.\" <em>Columbus Ledger-Enquirer</em>, Janaury 27: 14.</p><p>Harper, Carol. 2000. \"Dismay, disbelief follow mutilation death.\" <em>Sandusky Register</em>, January 26.</p><p>Johnson, Sheila. 2013. <em>Blood Highway.</em> New York, N...",

Having completed her degree at the University of Lincoln a few months earlier, Grace had spent several weeks traveling during her gap year but had been keeping in regular contact with her parents since leaving for her trip. When they still hadn’t heard from their daughter three days later, Grace’s parents called Auckland police and reported her missing.

A day later, investigators arrested twenty-six-year-old Jesse Kempson, who was the last person seen with Grace on the night of the murder when the two were captured together by a CCTV camera going up to Kempson’s room at the CityLife Hotel.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/uk-parliament-let-s-end-the-rough-sex-defence-604fb426-47ae-4d92-ad5a-75135fd020ff?recruiter=1022327168&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Please Consider Signing this Petition</a></p><p><br></p><p>Thank you to our favorite David White for research assistance</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>References</p><p>BBC News. 2018. <em>Grace Millane: Man appears in court charged with backpacker's murder.</em> December 10.

When they were finally able to extinguish the flames and search the home, they discovered the badly burned body of twenty-eight-year-old Dawn Hachney in her bed, where her husband had left her several hours earlier. After a brief investigation, Dawn’s death was determined to be the result of an accidental fire—a tragic end to a short life, nothing more.</p><p><br></p><p>The case, which most had considered closed years earlier, was revived in April of 2001, when a woman went to Bremerton Police with a startling statement. She claimed to have been having an affair with Dawn’s husband Nick, at the time of Dawn’s death and that, at some point during their affair, he’d confessed to drugging his wife and setting the house on fire to cover up the murder. Investigators took the woman’s claims very seriously; however, Nick Hacheney was a former minister, which added&nbsp;to people's perception of the case.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Thank you to the gorgeous, vibrant and talented David White for Research assistance</p><p><br></p><p>References:&nbsp;</p><p>Associated Press. 2002. \"Former minister on trial in wife's death.\"&nbsp;<em>The News Tribune</em>, November 11: 16.</p><p>Baker, Travis. 2003. \"Angry words erupt at Hacheney Sentencing.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, February 8: 1.</p><p>—. 2002. \"Defense presses woman who pointed finger.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, November 27: 4.</p><p>—. 2001. \"Ex-minister might face life in prison without parole.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, October 4: 1.</p><p>—. 2001. \"Ex-minister pleads innocent in wife's death.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, September 18: 1.</p><p>—. 2002. \"Former minister guilty of murdering wife.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, December 27: 1.</p><p>—. 2001. \"Hacheney denied reduced bail.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, October 27: 4.</p><p>—. 2002. \"Judge: Jury will hear of alleged wife killer's affairs.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, February 28: 10.</p><p>—. 2002. \"Pathologist testifies about changing autopsy results.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, November 13: 3.</p><p>—. 2002. \"Sexual affairs not relevant, attorney argues.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, February 9: 5.</p><p>—. 2002. \"Trial begins for ex-minister accused of killing wife.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, November 4: 1.</p><p>Kitsap Sun. 1997. \"Dawn Hacheney Obituary.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, December 30: 5.</p><p>McCormick, Julie. 2001. \"Former minister suspect in wife's death.\"&nbsp;<em>Kitsap Sun</em>, September 14: 1.</p><p>Olsen, Gregg. 2010.&nbsp;<em>A Twisted Faith: A Minister's Obsession and the Murder that Destroyed a Church.</em>&nbsp;New York, NY: St. Martin's Press.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-se...",

Detectives from the small town of Derry, NH arrived to find what appeared to be the scene of a robbery; though, very little looked to have been stolen and to investigators the scene felt staged. Two days later, Derry Police Captain Loring Jackson announced that Gregg Smart’s death wasn’t a random attacked, he’d been murdered by someone who knew him. The murder of Gregg Smart, and the trial that followed, shocked the population of New Hampshire, where it remains perhaps the most notorious criminal trial in the state’s history. As the first criminal trial to be televised from beginning to end, the case of Pamela Smart and her teenage lover captivated a national audience, leading to television and feature films, several nonfiction books, and countless television specials in the decades that followed.</p><p><br></p><p>Special thank you to the brilliant David White for research assistance</p><p>References</p><p>Baker, Frank. 1990. \"Smart to be jailed until trial.\" <em>Concord Monitor</em>, August 14: 1.</p><p>—. 1990. \"Widow charged as accomplice.\" <em>Concord Monitor</em>, August 2: 14.</p><p>Carton, Barbara. 1991. \"The Pamela Smart story.\" <em>Boston Globe</em>, Marcg 21.</p><p>1991. <em>NH v.

The case captivated the nation in the early 90's and at the center of it all, of course, was Pamela. A New Hampshire native, she had big dreams of becoming somebody and making a name for herself. She moved away from her small town and almost did, but in the name of love she moved back home and settled into her career as a School Administrator. It was via that position that she would meet young sophomore in High School, Billy Flynn. Pam groomed the boy, and had him thinking they were fully in love before she asked him a question that would change both of their lives forever: Would he murder her husband? In part one we'll cover the early life of both Pam and her husband, Gregg Smart, we'll break down how Pam and Billy became involved with each other and just how Pam got Billy to believe&nbsp;that murdering her husband was what it would take for them to be together forever.</p><p><br></p><p>Special thank you to the brilliant David White for research assistance</p><p><br></p><p>References</p><p>Baker, Frank. 1990. \"Smart to be jailed until trial.\" <em>Concord Monitor</em>, August 14: 1.</p><p>—. 1990. \"Widow charged as accomplice.\" <em>Concord Monitor</em>, August 2: 14.</p><p>Carton, Barbara. 1991. \"The Pamela Smart story.\" <em>Boston Globe</em>, Marcg 21.</p><p>1991. <em>NH v.

Peterson and Naomi Wolf discuss her original ambitions, the derailment of her scholarly career at the hands of misogyny, her rise to the forefront of third wave feminism as a best-selling author, and how the mainstream turned on her once she wrote on a topic the Left had blacklisted: COVID-19.</p><p> </p><p>Naomi Wolf is an American author and journalist. Her first book, “The Beauty Myth,” would challenge notions of attraction, arguing they are societally fabricated. This publication became an international bestseller and cemented Wolf as one of the leading spokeswomen for the third wave feminist movement. She has published many books since then, such as “The End of America, and Vagina: A New Biography.” In recent years, she has come under fire for being an “anti-vaxer” and a “conspiracy theorist,” which led Wolf to write her most recent book, “The Bodies of Others: The New Authoritarians, COVID-19 and The War Against the Human.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Dr. Naomi Wolf</p><p> </p><p>The Bodies of Others (Book): https://www.amazon.com/Bodies-Others-Authoritarians-COVID-19-Against/dp/1737478560</p><p> </p><p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/naomirwolf/?hl=en</p><p> </p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/naomirwolf?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor </p>\n",

Farrier talks to film critic David Chen of DecodingEverything.com to find out what made this film so patriotic it was literally named after the 4th of July. Farrier then tracks down Phil Grucci, President and CEO of “Fireworks by Grucci” - America’s so-called “First Family of Fireworks”. Grucci’s company holds the Guinness World Record for the \"Largest Fireworks Display\" ever recorded and he educates David about why fireworks are practically baked into the Declaration of Independence.\n<p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

David talks to Stephen Fox, an architectural historian and a lecturer at the Rice School of Architecture in Houston, who explains the practical reasons for these spaces, as well as why they’ve turned into habitable spaces. David then talks to filmmaker and architect Giorgio Angelini about what these spaces mean culturally to Americans, as paradoxically a place of safety and warmth but also of mystery and horror. The two of them discuss various formative experiences to be found in the attic, before David turns back to the egg episode, attempting to get closure with his best friend Rosabel following an incident where he cracked an egg over her head.\n<p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Why does America insist on the stovetop kettle when it could be boiling its water so much faster? To find out, David talks to Bruce Richardson, a tea master who founded Elmwood Inn Fine Teas in Kentucky, and wrote a book called “The New Tea Companion.” Bruce is a man obsessed with the correct boiling point of water, whose worst enemy is the microwave. Richardson teaches David about the shady events of 1773, in which a bunch of costumed protestors threw British tea into the ocean in a case of tea treason. Could these events still be felt today in America’s rejection of the British invention of the electric kettle? Or is it a voltage issue? Tony Gebely, author of “The Philosophy of Tea: A User's Guide” has some of his own theories - theories which lead the creator of America’s premiere electric kettle brand, Fellow. Jake Miller prefers his boiling water on coffee, not tea - and he argues (somewhat in jest) that the electric kettle could have a massive impact on America’s GDP. \n<p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Why does the sunshine state have more exotic animal species than any other state and, quite possibly, than any other country? David discovers that there are about 50 different reptile species now thriving in Florida - most of them imports. With that in mind, he explores the Burmese python, an escaped imported creature that is now eating alligators out in the Everglades, taking the position of top dog in the ecosystem. David wants to find out what happens to Florida’s unwanted exotic pets, visiting the Everglades Outpost in Homestead to meet skunks, foxes, and wolves - plus the odd goat, lion, and giraffe. He ends his trip by meeting Snakes, an exotic snake dealer who is dealing with the law changes in Florida.\n<p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

David is surprised to find that the strange offshoot of the Seventh Day Adventist church still exists and sits down to interview their new leader. Why are they still on the same grounds where so many terrible things happened? What do they believe? What do they think of Koresh? What is inside their church? And why did things go so crazy here 30 years ago, America essentially going after one man with an army of guns, helicopters, tear gas, 12 tanks, and almost 900 members of the FBI, ATF, Texas National Guard, the Army, the Waco police department, and the Texas Rangers.\n<p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

He also talks to photographer Micah Cash about his book Waffle House Vistas (https://bittersoutherner.com/) and why this generic shoebox restaurant is actually incredibly diverse and special.

David also meets the man behind the popular Instagram account @SandwichesOfHistory, Barry, who recreates sandwiches of yore. Why were ancient sandwiches so disgusting?
