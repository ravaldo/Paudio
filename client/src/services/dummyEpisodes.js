Molly and Colt leave the house party with a local guy that they both know. His name is James Conn Nipp. Nipp is known well in the area by both civilians and members of local law enforcement. Nipp decided to piss off the police. He was practically begging them for a high speed chase, something he had done several times before. After the police chase Nipp goes home. Molly and Colt have not been seen since. Grab a beer and cool down in the Garage with Nic and the Captain.

Molly and Colt leave the house party with a local guy that they both know. His name is James Conn Nipp. Nipp is known well in the area by both civilians and members of local law enforcement. Nipp decided to piss off the police. He was practically begging them for a high speed chase, something he had done several times before. After the police chase Nipp goes home. Molly and Colt have not been seen since. Grab a beer and cool down in the Garage with Nic and the Captain.

There are good suspects in this case but have all of the possible leads dried up? Back in July of 1999, Heather Kullorn was babysitting an infant overnight. This is odd especially giving the ages. Heather was twelve and the infant was just a little over two months old. Given the ages an overnight babysitting gig does not seem appropriate at all. Heather disappeared in the middle of the night. Blood was found at the scene. The baby thankfully was alive and well when the parents returned home. Police were called and the authorities have been looking for Heather for over twenty years now. We believe the person or persons responsible have likely shared intimate knowledge of the case with someone. If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Heather Kullorn please call the St. Louis Police Department at 314-231-1212. To remain anonymous please call Crimestoppers at 1-866-371-TIPS. </p><p>Beer of the Week - Zipper Ripper by Hoof Hearted Brewing </p><p>Garage Grade - 4 and a half bottle caps out of 5 </p><p>Check out our other show Off The Record available on Apple Subscription, right in the True Crime Garage Apple Podcast feed. </p>\n",

There are good suspects in this case but have all of the possible leads dried up? Back in July of 1999, Heather Kullorn was babysitting an infant overnight. This is odd especially giving the ages. Heather was twelve and the infant was just a little over two months old. Given the ages an overnight babysitting gig does not seem appropriate at all. Heather disappeared in the middle of the night. Blood was found at the scene. The baby thankfully was alive and well when the parents returned home. Police were called and the authorities have been looking for Heather for over twenty years now. We believe the person or persons responsible have likely shared intimate knowledge of the case with someone. If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Heather Kullorn please call the St. Louis Police Department at 314-231-1212. To remain anonymous please call Crimestoppers at 1-866-371-TIPS. </p><p>Beer of the Week - Zipper Ripper by Hoof Hearted Brewing </p><p>Garage Grade - 4 and a half bottle caps out of 5 </p><p>Check out our other show Off The Record available on Apple Subscription, right in the True Crime Garage Apple Podcast feed. </p>\n",

The group attended a local party. What happened at the party is up for debate. By the early morning hours of the next day Jason will be dead. Supposedly, Jason and another boy both intoxicated decided on their walk home to lay down in the middle of the road and they both fell asleep or passed out. According to the witness (the driver) Jason was run over to avoid running over the other boy. We will tell you the problems with this story, the investigation or lack thereof and why the facts of the narrative just don’t add up. </p><p>Beer of the Week - Fossil Cove’s Session IPA </p><p>Garage Grade - 4 and a quarter bottle caps </p><p>For additional coverage of the Jonbenet Ramsey case, the Delphi Double Murders case, our bonus shows The Bricca Family Murders and Tony Muncy along with access to our first 50 episodes - Subscribe to our show “Off The Record” available on Apple Podcast.

Serial Killer /// Part 1 /// 173</p><p>Part 1 of 2</p><p>www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</p><p>December 8th, 1996 - An overweight man picks up a woman from a local bar in southwest Baltimore. He invites her back to his trailer with the promise of drugs and alcohol. She decides to join him. They are only there a short time when he starts making sexual advances toward her. She turns him down. They do some drugs and then his advances became more aggressive. She continues to brush him off and then he attacks her. Somehow she manages to escape and have the man arrested. Just days later this man is arrested again this time for the murder of a young woman. After, he starts talking to investigators about other murders. Tonight we discuss Joe Metheny, his crimes and confessions.

They were both just sixteen years old.  Today Laura would be just 40 years old and Ashley 39.</p><p>Laura is Native American. She is listed at 5’5 inches tall, with Brown hair, and hazel eyes. She may have been wearing a blue shirt, jeans, white sneakers or black boots, and silver heart-shaped earrings with imbedded diamonds.</p><p>Ashley Freeman is caucasian, 5 foot 7 inches tall.  She has Blonde hair, and blue eyes. Ashley had an athletic build in 1999. She may have been wearing a t-shirt, jeans, a baseball cap, white sneakers, a windbreaker and a class ring inscribed with the phrase \"Bluejacket High School Class of 2000.\"</p><p>If you have any information of the possible whereabouts of Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman, or if you have any further information about Ronnie Busick, Warren Phil Welch or David Pennington or any other criminal activity that any or all of these guys were involved in please contact the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation 1-800-522-8017.  Or you can email the show TrueCrimeGarage@gmail.com</p>\n",

The killer was apparently attacking people that he saw walking alone. Since then police have not been able to link anymore attacks or killings. Did the killer go dark or has he moved on to another hunting ground? If anyone has information about these attacks or the suspect, call Little Rock Police at 501-371-4636 or email at ASKLRPD@littlerock.gov  There is a reward available for up to $20,000. </p><p>Beer of the Week - Trailbound Hazy Juicy Ale by Highland Brewing </p><p>Garage Grade - 4 and a half bottle caps out of 5 </p><p>Recommended Reading - Devil’s Knot; the true story of the west Memphis three by Mara Leveritt </p>\n",
